# Leave-the-water-in-the-city
Individual work, 2020.11-2021.1

This project discussed the possibility for the healthy expansion of cities after introducing water into them. 

This project originated from the conjecture of bringing water from the Bohai Sea into Xinjiang. The idea is that after more water enters Urumchi, it can be stored in the city through urban green space design, and the overall environmental quality of the city can be improved.
